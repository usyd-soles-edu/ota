#' Compare Roster Changes Between Latest Log Files
#'
#' Detects additions, removals, and replacements between the two latest
#' roster log files for a given unit. This function reads the previous and
#' latest snapshots and compares them to identify what has changed.
#'
#' @param df A dataframe with roster data, typically returned by \code{\link{roster}()}.
#'   Must have attributes \code{unit} and \code{file_path} set.
#'
#' @return A list containing:
#'   \item{changes}{A list with elements:
#'     \itemize{
#'       \item{additions}{Rows in latest log not in previous log (new assignments)}
#'       \item{removals}{Rows in previous log not in latest log (removed assignments)}
#'       \item{replacements}{Slots where a person was replaced by another}
#'     }
#'   }
#'   \item{df}{The input dataframe}
#'
#' @details
#' Both the latest and previous log files are processed with 
#' \code{\link{mutate_tutor_roles}()} before comparison to ensure consistent
#' tutor role labeling.
#'
#' Replacements are detected by matching on common columns (date, day, start, 
#' end, location, role, week) where different names appear between versions.
#' These are then removed from the additions and removals lists.
