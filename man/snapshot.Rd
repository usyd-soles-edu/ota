\title{Create a Timestamped Snapshot of the Roster}
\usage{
snapshot(df, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with roster data, typically returned by \code{\link{roster}()}.
Must have attributes \code{file_path} and \code{unit} set.}

\item{force}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), only saves a snapshot if the 
current roster differs from the latest snapshot. If \code{TRUE}, always saves 
a new snapshot regardless of changes.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input dataframe, allowing for function chaining.
}
\description{
Saves the current roster to a timestamped CSV file in the logs directory.
This function is used to record roster states over time for comparison and
change tracking. By default, snapshots are only saved if there are differences 
from the latest existing snapshot.
}
\details{
The function creates a \code{logs} subdirectory in the same directory as
the source roster file. CSV files are named with the pattern:
\code{<unit>-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.csv}

Before saving, the function applies \code{\link{mutate_tutor_roles}()} to
mark the first tutor role per person-week as "Tutor" and subsequent tutor
roles in the same week as "Tutor (repeat)".

If the current roster is identical to the latest snapshot and \code{force = FALSE},
no new snapshot is created and a message is displayed. When \code{force = TRUE},
a snapshot is always created even if no changes are detected.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load roster and create snapshot (only if changed)
df <- roster("path/to/roster.xlsx", unit = "biol1007")
snapshot(df)

# Force snapshot creation regardless of changes
snapshot(df, force = TRUE)
}
