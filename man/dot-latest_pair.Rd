\title{Read the Two Latest Log Files for a Unit}
\usage{
.latest_pair(unit, logs_dir)
}
\arguments{
\item{unit}{A character string identifying the unit (e.g., "biol1007").}

\item{logs_dir}{The directory path where log CSV files are stored.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
  \item{latest}{Dataframe of the most recent log file}
  \item{previous}{Dataframe of the second-most recent log file}
  
  Returns \code{NULL} if fewer than 2 log files exist for the unit. This
  ensures \code{compare()} can only execute when there are two snapshots
  to compare.
}
\description{
An internal helper function that retrieves and reads the two most recent
timestamped log files for a given unit. Used exclusively by \code{\link{compare}()} to
detect changes between successive snapshots.
}
\details{
Log files are identified by the pattern \code{<unit>-*.csv} in the
logs directory. Files are sorted by name (which corresponds to timestamp
due to YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss naming convention) to identify the latest two.

This function is specifically designed for \code{\link{compare}()} and
requires at least 2 log files to exist. For checking if current data
matches the latest log file, \code{\link{snapshot}()} has its own internal
comparison logic and does not use this function.
