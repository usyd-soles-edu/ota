document_changes(compare_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{compare_result}{A list returned by \code{\link{compare}()}, containing
changes (a list of additions, removals, and replacements) and the original dataframe.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
This function takes the result from a comparison and prints a formatted,
color-coded summary of changes including additions (in green), removals 
(in red), and replacements (showing old crossed-out and new in green).
The output is organized by date with a formatted table layout and includes
helpful emoji indicators (ðŸŸ¢ for additions, ðŸ”´ for removals, ðŸ”„ for replacements).
}
\details{
The function displays changes in a formatted table with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item{Date}{The date of the roster change}
  \item{Type}{The type of change (Addition, Removal, or Replacement)}
  \item{Details}{Person name(s) and role with emoji indicator, with color coding}
  \item{Activity}{Week, day, time, and lab location}
}

Emoji indicators:
\itemize{
  \item{ðŸŸ¢}{Addition - new person added to a slot}
  \item{ðŸ”´}{Removal - person removed from a slot}
  \item{ðŸ”„}{Replacement - person replaced by another in the same slot}
}

Color coding: additions are shown in green, removals in red, and replacements
show the removed name struck through in red and the new name in bold green.
