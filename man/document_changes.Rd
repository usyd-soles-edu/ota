document_changes(compare_result)
}
\arguments{
\item{compare_result}{A list returned by \code{\link{compare}()}, containing
changes (a list of additions, removals, replacements, and paycode_changes) 
and the original dataframe.}
}

\description{
This function takes the result from a comparison and prints a formatted,
color-coded summary of changes including additions (in green), removals 
(in red), replacements (showing old crossed-out and new in green), and
paycode changes (showing role transitions). The output is organized by date 
with a formatted table layout and includes helpful emoji indicators.
}
\details{
The function displays changes in a formatted table with the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item{Date}{The date of the roster change}
  \item{Type}{The type of change (Addition, Removal, Replacement, or Paycode change)}
  \item{Details}{Person name(s) and role(s) with emoji indicator, with color coding}
  \item{Activity}{Week, day, time, and lab location}
}

Emoji indicators:
\itemize{
  \item{ðŸŸ¢}{Addition - new person added to a slot}
  \item{ðŸ”´}{Removal - person removed from a slot}
  \item{ðŸ”„}{Replacement - person replaced by another in the same slot}
  \item{ðŸ’°}{Paycode change - person's role changed in the same slot (e.g., Tutor (repeat) â†’ Tutor)}
}

Color coding: additions are shown in green, removals in red, replacements
show the removed name struck through in red and the new name in bold green.
Paycode changes show the person's name in bold green with the old role in red
and the new role in green.
