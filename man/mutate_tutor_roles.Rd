\usage{
mutate_tutor_roles(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with columns: name, week, role}
}
\value{
The input dataframe with the role column updated according to the
  tutor repeat logic.
}
\description{
Marks the first tutor role for each person in each week as "Tutor" and
all subsequent tutor roles within that week as "Tutor (repeat)". All other
roles (e.g., Demonstrator) are left unchanged.
}
\details{
This function groups by name and week, then for rows where role == "Tutor",
marks the first occurrence as "Tutor" and subsequent ones as "Tutor (repeat)".
Other roles are preserved as-is.
